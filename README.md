# Compass
### Give your plans a sense of direction.

## **Overview**
Compass is a one-stop travel itinerary.

After the user creates an account (or logs in), they can start planning a new trip by clicking on the “Plan A Trip” button. They will then enter the place they are going and the start and end dates. From there, they are taken to the timeline page which has been populated with boxes for each day of their trip. Users can then add events to each day. Every trip is saved to their profile so they can leave and come back to it whenever they want.
